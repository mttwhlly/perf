# Frontend Framework Benchmark Suite

A comprehensive benchmark suite for frontend frameworks, focusing on performance, scalability, and developer experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Generate all implementations:
```bash
npm run init
npm run setup
```

4. Run the benchmarks:
```bash
npm run benchmark
```

## Test Scenario Setup

Identical test components in each framework implementation:

1. Form Handling Test:
- Complex form with 50+ fields
- Dynamic validation
- Conditional fields
- Multi-step workflow

2. Realtime Updates Test:
- WebSocket connection
- High-frequency updates
- Data transformation
- State synchronization

3. Animation Performance Test:
- Complex CSS animations
- Canvas-based animations
- SVG animations
- Layout transitions

4. WebSocket Test:
- Connection management
- Message handling
- Reconnection logic
- Data synchronization

5. DOM Manipulation Test:
- Large list rendering
- Virtual scrolling
- Dynamic updates
- Complex layouts

## Results Analysis

Results will be generated in the `results/` directory:
- Detailed JSON reports
- HTML visualizations
- Performance traces
- Bundle analysis reports

## Additional Notes

1. Environment Setup:
- Use Node.js 18+ for consistent results
- Ensure all browsers are up to date
- Run on similar hardware for comparable results

2. Test Data:
- Use provided test data generators
- Maintain consistent data sizes
- Document any modifications

3. Reporting:
- Results are saved in `results/{timestamp}/`
- Each run creates a new directory
- Includes raw data and analyzed metrics

4. Troubleshooting:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify network conditions
- Monitor system resources
- Use provided debugging tools
